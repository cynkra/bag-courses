# scripts and functions

* script : A sequence of operation, storing previous results in the global
  environment, importing/exporting at different stages
* function : A separate piece of code with its own local variables
  (with few exceptions, and fewer desirable exceptions)
  
Scripts are encapsulated in **files**

Functions are encapsulated in **objects**
(defined in scripts)

---

# scripts are great!

* We can run them as we code
* No need to worry about argument, function names... 
* No overhead, faster + easier, we have deadlines!
* We see all there is, sequentially
* Easier to debug by less advanced users
* Great as sandboxes
* We at least need one!

---

# scripts are great but...

* I copy and pasted this part, now I need to change it, need to copy changes in 3 places.
* Oops, it was 4. Forgot to change that one.
* This looks like a copy paste of the above, but is it ?
* What do I have in my workspace ?
* Didn't I define this variable (oh maybe I cut and pasted it further down)?
* Oops I think I overwrote this `n` variable I needed
* I'll comment out this part, because we don't always need it.
* After which script am I supposed to run this one ?
* Should I run script 5A AND 5B, or 5A OR 5B ? Can I skip script 3 ? Why is there
no script 4 ?

---

# scripts are limited

* R is so great to program interactively, would be a shame not to enjoy this feature
* But once you have a chunk of code that does something precise (even if called once),
  it's time to clean up the abstraction :
  * name it
  * define the inputs
  * store it
  * document it
  * test it
  
??? We won't talk about documenting and testing in depth here, you'll learn about it in the
workshop about package development

---

# functions

* reusability 
  * Need to be correct in only one place! 
* abstraction
  * has a clear goal, summarized in its name and developped in its doc
  * Has clear inputs
  * Has a clear output (might be a list, that's still one output!)
* Show reader only what they need to know, each action that deserves a label
  has one
  
Thanks to these qualities, you can build functions on functions, and no
need to understand or remember the details of the functions you call.

---

# Style

Set of rules or guidelines used when writing the source code for a computer program.

Deals with naming, spaces, identation, when to go to the line...

* Good style is partly subjective though some decisions are arguably just good, i.e. indenting code
* Better than any style : consistent style
* Easier to adopt a prominent style than make your own
* Easier for your users and collaborators to feel at home too!

???
The most important thing about a style guide is that it provides consistency, 
making code easier to write because you need to make fewer decisions.

---

# Style

Good news : the tidyverse has a great style guide

https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html

Better news : No need to know it to apply most of it! thanks to {styler}

---

# Style


```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("styler")
```

<img src="styler.png" alt=""/>

???
{styler} will help you apply a code style to your current file or current selection.
There's a lot of customization you could do but you won't need any.

We encourage you to use styler, to see what it does and to incorporate it
progressively directly in your code.

---

# Naming conventions

Part of style but {styler} cannot help.

Naming is hard!

* Use "snake_case" (lower case, underscore separated) for all names
  * `_` confusion with S3 methods
  * No capital : easier to write nad type (controversial)
* Name functions as verbs :
  * good : `analyse_prod()`
  * bad : `prod_analysis()`, `analysed_prod()`
* better have longer name than obscure name
  * bad : `anprod()`
* Avoid overriding base functions
* Consistency in names, families of functions should have similarly named members
  * bad : `check_not_too_big`, `fail_if_is_too_small()`

---

# Design principles

Design covers:

* inputs
* outputs/side effects
* errors
* ...

https://design.tidyverse.org

???

The tidyverse design guide is a great read and it goes with more details into what 
we will cover. It shows also many examples and counter examples that we didn't have
time to cover, and some exceptions to a few rules we propose. So definitely check
it out if you want to perfect your understanding about function design.

---

# Avoid hidden arguments

All inputs to a function should be explicit arguments. Avoid functions that surprise the user by returning different results when the inputs look the same.

```{r}
# setup.R
path <- "my_file.csv"

# functions.R
do_something <- function() {
  data <- readr::read_csv(path)
  # something
}

# analysis.R
do_something()
```

???
A function should almost always return the same thing when called the same
way. Here if we change `path` we'll get something different, and it's hard to debug!

A big advantage of functions over scripts is that it allows breaking problems 
down into small self contained pieces.

---

# Avoid hidden arguments

good

```{r}
# setup.R
path <- "my_file.csv"

# functions.R
do_something <- function(path) {
  data <- readr::read_csv(path)
  # something
}

# analysis.R
do_something(path)
```

???

Note that if the content of the file changes, the output also changes.
However if `path` is en explicit argument to the function
this won't surprise the user if there is a path argument.

If the path is really always the same you might set it as a default argument

Sometimes this might mean you have to pass along arguments down from function
to function, so setting global variables seems so much easier: Don't do it!


---

# Data, descriptors, details

arguments should always come in  same order: data, descriptors, details

* Data args : core data. Required, often called `data`, `x`, or `y`.

* Descriptor args : Essential details of the operation, usually required.

* Details args : optional (they have default values), typically scalars (e.g. `na.rm = TRUE`, `n = 10`, `prop = 0.1`).

???
Data args are required, and are usually vectors and often determine the type 
and size of the output. Data arguments are often called data, x, or y.

Most functions respect this and it is often intuitive, it is good however to
elevate this at the rank of a design rule. Not event all base R functions respect this
and it causes problems, among them `lm()` and `grepl()` are common offenders.

`...` can sometimes play the role of the data argument but often better avoided.

The difference between descriptors and details is not always clear cut but it's
still a useful distinction

---

# Data, descriptors, details

categorize arguments of these functions : 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# good
mean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...)
      
merge(x, y, by = intersect(names(x), names(y)), by.x = by, 
    by.y = by, all = FALSE, all.x = all, all.y = all, sort = TRUE, 
    suffixes = c(".x", ".y"), no.dups = TRUE, incomparables = NULL, 
    ...) 

# bad
gsub(pattern, replacement, x, ignore.case = FALSE, perl = FALSE, 
    fixed = FALSE, useBytes = FALSE)

lm(formula, data, subset, weights, na.action, method = "qr", 
    model = TRUE, x = FALSE, y = FALSE, qr = TRUE, singular.ok = TRUE, 
    contrasts = NULL, offset, ...)
```

???
`gsub()` has descriptors first, then data, then details

`lm()` is similar but has other problems, some details argument have no default and yet 
are not mandatory. That's confusing! And bring us to our next point

---

# Default arguments

Optional arguments should have defaults

* If the argument is not used if missing, set its default value to `NULL`
* If it has a default value that is too complex to integrate to the function
definition, set the default to `NULL` and sort it out in the code (but document it properly!)
* Avoid using the `missing()` function, unless it's to trigger an early failure
* Use getOption() to allow the user to set default values. Only use to control the side-effects of a function, not its computed value!

???

When reading a function, it’s important to be able to tell at a glance which 
arguments must be supplied and which are optional. Otherwise you need to rely 
on the user having carefully read the documentation.

---

# Enumerate possible options

If an argument as a limited set of possible string values : use `match.arg()` or 
`rlang::arg_match``

```{r}
difftime(time1, time2, tz, units = c("auto", "secs", "mins", "hours", "days", "weeks")) 
```

And then body of the function contains:

```{r}
units <- match.arg(units)
```

Users know the choices directly from autocomplete.


---

# Dots

* `...` should be placed before the details arguments.
* Don’t use `...` just to save the user from typing c() (unless the function is purely for data structure creation).
* Carefully consider if all other arguments need a `.` prefix in order to reduce the chance of spurious matches.
* check that all inputs in `...` are evaluated.

---

# Output

* In case of multiple outputs use a list and name elements
  * If it returns vectors of the same length, return a tibble
* functions called primarily for their side-effects should invisibly return a useful value.

---

# Type-stability

The less you need to know about a function’s inputs to predict the type of its output, the better. 

A function should ideally either :

* always return the same type of thing
* return something that can be trivially computed from its inputs.

With a type-stable function:

* output type depends only on input types (not values).
* Order of `...` args does not affect the output type.

---

# Type-stability

Can you predict those outputs ?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
typeof(median(1:3))
typeof(median(1:4))
median(factor(1:2))
median(Sys.Date() + 0:1)
median("foo")
median(c("foo", "bar"))
```

---

# Type-stability

* It doesn't always return the same type of thing
* The output type doesnt depends only on input types

```{r, error = TRUE}
typeof(median(1:3))
typeof(median(1:4))
median(factor(1:2))
median(Sys.Date() + 0:1)
median("foo")
median(c("foo", "bar"))
```

???

Problems created by this behavior are rare for `median()`, that's why the function
stayed tis way, but you'll avoid issues by paying attention to those principles

# Errors

* don’t display the call when generating an error message.

* if the same error is generated by multiple functions, you should extract it out into its own function, an error constructor.

---

# Side-effects

2 types :

* those that give feedback to the user.
  * `print()` `message()`, `warning()`, `stop()`, `plot()` ...
* those that change some global state.
  * `library()`, `setwd()`, `assign()`, `write.csv()`, `set.seed()`,
  `install.packages()`...
  
---

# Side-effects

* Never change global state without making sure the user know what they're doing
  (clear name and doc)
* Consider adding a message when you do change a global state
* Avoid mixing side-effects and computation

???

It’s not side-effects that are bad, so much as mixing them with non-side-effect code.

Put them in a function that is specifically focussed on the side-effect.
